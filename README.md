# Crack Detection Model

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting cracks in images. The model is trained to classify images of surfaces as either having a crack or not having a crack.

## Overview

The project involves:
- Training a CNN model on a dataset of images with and without cracks.
- Developing a Streamlit web application to allow users to upload images and classify them as having a crack or not.
- Deploying the web application for public access.

## Files in This Repository

- `crack_detection_model.h5`: The trained CNN model saved in HDF5 format.
- `app.py`: The Streamlit app code for uploading and classifying images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Streamlit app locally, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. If you're using Streamlit Sharing, the dependencies will be installed automatically.

### Installing Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content to specify the dependencies:
